# Pawsome Connections 

## About

Welcome to üêæPawsome Connections, a web application created by a team of four passionate developers who share a love for animals. We developed this application in hopes to help older animals and animals who have been waiting to be adopted over 30 days get adopted.

With üêæPawsome Connections, users can browse a list of animals eagerly awaiting their perfect match. Seamlessly search for your ideal companion by animal type and location, tailoring your quest to find that special fur-ever friend.  User's are also able to favorite their dream pets and view all their selected favorites on a seperate page, ensuring they're just a whisker away whenever they're ready to make their final choice. Does an adorable cat catch your eye? You can click on the card to view a more detailed view on information about their potential match and how they can take the next steps to adopt.

During this project, we challenged ourselves to self-teach and implement a new technology TypeScript for improved code organization and enhanced type safety. Our team utilized their newly acquired skills in TypeScript, React, and Router to create a seamless and capitivatin user experience to help solve a problem with dogs needing a home.
